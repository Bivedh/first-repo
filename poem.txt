The sun is shining bright,
The birds are taking flight,
The world is full of light,
And everything is right.

The flowers are in bloom,
The air is filled with perfume,
The world is full of room,
And there's no sense of gloom.

The sky is blue and clear,
There's nothing left to fear,
The world is full of cheer,
And happiness is near.
